Simply drop in a Core Data model and build.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example Data Model\r\n\r\nThis application includes a moderately complex Core Data model to demonstrate the usage of this tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nPSModelViewer is a rough yet workable solution for instantly creating an interactive reference for Core Data development work.  It is meant to be quickly updated with minimum effort and rebuilt each time the data model changes.\r\n\r\nThis project follows the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) standard. The API may change in backwards-incompatible ways before the 1.0 release.\r\n\r\nThe goal of PSModelViewer is to build an application that consumes an unmodified Core Data model and presents browsable representation of its' structure.  This is intended to be a mobile / interactive reference during development.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can generate documentation with [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). The example project includes a documentation build target to do this within Xcode.    For more details, see the [Documentation](https://github.com/epreston/PSModelViewer/wiki/Documentation) page in this projects wiki.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute to PSModelViewer, start by forking this repository on GitHub:\r\n\r\nhttp://github.com/epreston/PSModelViewer\r\n\r\nThe best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Clone down your fork\r\n1. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change\r\n1. Hack away\r\n1. Add tests and make sure everything still passes\r\n1. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README\r\n1. Do not change the version number, I will do that on my end\r\n1. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors\r\n1. Push the branch up to GitHub\r\n1.
