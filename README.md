# PSModelViewer

PSModelViewer is an iPad application that allows you to browse a Core Data model on the go.  Simply drop in a Core Data model and build.


# Example Data Model

This application includes a moderately complex Core Data model to demonstrate the usage of this tool.


# Status

PSModelViewer is a rough yet workable solution for instantly creating an interactive reference for Core Data development work.  It is meant to be quickly updated with minimum effort and rebuilt each time the data model changes.

This project follows the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) standard. The API may change in backwards-incompatible ways before the 1.0 release.

The goal of PSModelViewer is to build an application that consumes an unmodified Core Data model and presents browsable representation of its' structure.  This is intended to be a mobile / interactive reference during development.


# Documentation

You can generate documentation with [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). The example project includes a documentation build target.

Documentation is a work in progress.
